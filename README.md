Firmus Python Challenge

Background :

The Marching Doubler is a series that looks as follows:
1,1,2,3,1,2,2,3,1,2,3,3,1,1,2,3 ...

Observe that there are "runs" of length 4 in the above example, where one term in each run is
doubled. The series repeats from the beginning when the doubled term reaches the end of a run.

Re-written for readability:
1,1,2,3, 1,2,2,3, 1,2,3,3, 1,1,2,3, ...

The series would look as follows if it had a run of length 5:
1,1,2,3,4,1,2,2,3,4,1,2,3,3,4,1, ...
